# TransFuse: Transfer learning on multi-omic graph fusion network

TransFuse v1.0
Yan's Lab, Indiana University Indianapolis
Developed by Linhui Xie

## Description
TransFuse is an interpretable multi-omic graph neural network to identify multi-omic disease network modules. It was extended from MoFNet (https://github.com/JW-Yan/MoFNet) and additonally addressed the missing data issue commonly observed in multi-omic data collections through a transfer learning approach. 


## Installation
The following libraries are required,

Python >= 3.7

pandas >= 1.2

numpy >= 1.20

PyTorch >= 0.5

captum >= 0.3.0

argparse >= 0.1.0

sklearn >= 1.0.2


## Usage
Prepare your multi-omic matrix data in .csv format. Each row should contain the multi-omic data of one participant, with columns representing the multi-omic features. The adjacency matrix should also be in .csv format, with rows and columns corresponding to the total number of multi-omic features. Place all input files in the same directory.

To run the code, use one of the following commands in your terminal, specifying the path to your dataset folder and the desired training mode:

$ python transfuse_main.py /path_to_your_dataset/ pretrain

$ python transfuse_main.py /path_to_your_dataset/ baseline

$ python transfuse_main.py /path_to_your_dataset/ transferweight

$ python transfuse_main.py /path_to_your_dataset/ fine-tune


## Contents
You can request access the real dataset through AD knowledge portal(https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org) with synapse #.
For the detailed information under this repository, the root folder contains following scripts,
transfuse_main.py contains the main structure.
model.py contains all input information to the pipeline .
train.py contains the training part of this method.
utils.py contains all utility functions that will be applied in the approach.


## Information
 * LR: learning rate to this structure.
 * L1REG: L1 norm regularization penalty.
 * L2REG: weight decay.
